Build 21
Removed mercurial wand infusion recipe, you can now properly use any cap you like on the core.
Gave the mercurial wand core a name that more closely follows the naming convention of the rest of the cores

Build 20
Fixed several issues with the ethereal jar which was causing desync issues between client and server
Fixed issue with mcmod.info file.
Changed how the fertilizer works.  It now uses herba to fertilize (ala the lamp of growth) which will cause normal plant
growth and can spread certain plants like mushrooms, lilypads and flowers.  Hydrating soil is now a free function
so you no longer need to worry about accidentally running out of aqua and having your farmland dry up.
Fixed NPE crash when right clicking a flux dissipator with an empty hand.
Ethereal jars now retain their labels when broken and placed.

Build 19
Quick fix to a bug that was causing random items to disappear from creative tabs.
Fixed bug where labels always apply to the same direction on ethereal jars.

Build 18
Fixed TickManager crash on servers.
Fixed labels causing crash when affixing to ethereal jars.
Fixed thaumonomicon pages for ethereal jar.

Build 17
Fixed wand tooltip to correctly show vis discount from armor, and not the current Ignis modifier
Added Herba as a requirement for the actual fertilization component of the fertilizer.  Watering still requires Aqua, of course
Added beginnings of wand pommels.  Currently only available via the creative menu.
Added [AT] tag to AT research
Fixed bug with flux dissipator where it was acting derpy with goo/gas, and not saving contained vitium between save/load
Fixed fertilizer and flux dissipator to not insta-break and drop no block.
Fixed bug with flux ventilator where you could not remove vitium with a phial.
Fixed depth rendering bug with the flux dissipator orb
Increased the rate at which the flux ventilator converts liquid goo to gas.
Fixed essentia particle position for the fertilizer.
Fertilizer now spreads flowers.

Build 16
Removed red marker particles from the fertilizer.  Oops, debug code!
Reduced fertilizer chance to non-debug levels
Fixed FloatyLineFX crash on dedicated servers.  One of these days, it WILL work. I promise!
Fixed variable swap that was causing node modification to freeze upon 'eating' an essence from a pedestal.
Removed debug code from wand
Added a config option to use the classic TC4 wand tooltip.  You can also see this tooltip by holding Shift

Build 15
Changed several block materials to dirt to allow block drops when using any tool to break it, and not just picks
Redid the Node Modifier thaumonomicon pages to better explain and illustrate the new node modifier mechanics.

Build 14
Extended the fertilizer to support any crop or sapling that extends BlockCrops, BlockStem, BlockSapling.  This should inherently add lots of mod support by default (if the mod author codes their crops and saplings correctly!)
Extended the fertilizer to work on reeds, cacti, and mana beans
Extended the fertilizer to spread mushrooms and lilypads
Fixed RenderManager crash when using the mod on a dedicated server

Build 13
Swapped out node modifier model for a lower poly count version.
Fixed the crazy text in the mercurial wand tooltip (damn you, UTF-8!)
Fixed the fertilizer.  Oops.
Set the correct research flags for the fertilizer.
Made the node modifier slightly more sturdy; the slightest touch should no longer break it
Fixed the 'break' texture on the node modifier
Node modifier no longer plays failure sound if it doesn't actually fail an operation
Added particle effects to modifier while it's active
Added the ethereal jar, stores 256 essentia (creative only at the moment, needs testing)
Gave some items and blocks more sane aspects when scanned.
Added in the flux ventilator for testing (creative only at the moment)
Fixed config code to actually allow disabling of features.  Everything related to this is now under the "Feature Control" group in the config
